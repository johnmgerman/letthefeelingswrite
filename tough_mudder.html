Throughout life, you can be around many,<br />
but feel like you are the only one there.<br /> 
A race of life, but a race by yourself;<br />
but what if the race of life<br />
wasn't the way it is.<br />
An obstacle arose that you couldn't overcome,<br />
but hands reached down to lift you above.<br />
People you never met wanting to help<br />
like they were always there.<br />
A twenty-foot cargo net,<br />
an Everest climb,<br />
people waited to help someone they never met.<br />
And they would get nothing out of it<br />
besides the goodness of the help they gave.<br />
What if life became an obstacle course?<br />
What if that camaraderie became life's internal motto?<br />
To not know who they are, but to love them like you do.<br />
An obstacle arose and all that remained<br />
was the obstacle itself.<br />
