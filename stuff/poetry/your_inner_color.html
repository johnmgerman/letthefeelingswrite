When life seems to cast you out,<br />
and you don't fit in.<br />
When the world seems colorless,<br />
even when the rainbow comes out.<br />
When the wind blows the trash,<br />
leaving the world a mess.<br />
When the leaves start to wither,<br />
like the thoughts dreaming of doubt.<br />
<br />
None of that matters,<br />
none of that changes<br />
all of you,<br />
that you have,<br />
inside ...<br />
<br />
Always remember,<br />
the shades of life,<br />
never dull<br />
your inner color.<br />
