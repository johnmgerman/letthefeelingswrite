A child-like imagination<br />
grows from within.<br />
Knowledge blossoms<br />
with excitement.<br />
Wondrous what if's<br />
erupt.<br />
<br />
Doubtful uncertainty begins<br />
to creep through.<br />
Wondrous what if's morph<br />
to negative what if's.<br />
Ignorance's fears enhance<br />
the negativity,<br />
wanting to weigh you down.<br />
Wanting to trap you,<br />
while knowledge wants to<br />
free you.<br />
<br />
Never surrender your<br />
thoughts to the limits ignorance<br />
wants you to think you have.<br />
Free yourself.<br />
Free your imagination.<br />
Free to be limitless.<br />
