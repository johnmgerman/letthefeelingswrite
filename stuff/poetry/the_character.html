Lovingly passionate, embracing the character of our hearts.<br />
Who we are, where we are the character of our thoughts.<br />
<br />
If we could fee like one another,<br />
if we dare to sense the character of one another,<br />
the hopes we all have, may become<br />
the character of one.<br />
<br />
Would you do and behave towards someome you don't know<br />
like someone you do?<br />
<br />
If we all looked at one another like the love of another,<br />
would the character of ourselves be the same?<br />
<br />
If every one's face was the face of someone we cared for,<br />
would we all care enough to help?<br />
<br />
Every day a loved one is out there,<br />
every day a loved one needs your help.<br />
<br />
May the eyes of our soul embrace each other<br />
like they are our own.<br />
<br />
The character of all,<br />
can help us become the character within each other.<br />
A world embracing a character of one family.<br />
