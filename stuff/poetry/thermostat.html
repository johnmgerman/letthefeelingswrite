I am always helping, even when you don't think of me,<br />
I am constantly there for you, no matter how much people see.<br />
Like a security system, I am within to be there,<br />
my hope is to always remain to keep what you are looking for fair.<br />
Each day that passes will be just like the others,<br />
Warmly watching over, with the love of a handful of caring mothers.<br />
wanting to keep the feeling, feeling snug,<br />
every second becoming like a compassionate hug.<br />
I will continue to cover like a well-fitted hat,<br />
wouldn't it be great if everyone behaved like a thermostat?<br />
