Whenever you have a moment, you may sit with me,<br />
anytime is good, my time is always free.<br />
My happiness comes when we are together,<br />
hopefully our time helps unwind the stresses so they become as light as a feather.<br />
Stretch across, don't mind me at all,<br />
let the relaxation of me help your mind fall into a deep crawl.<br />
Pay no attention to how long you are here,<br />
your comfort is what makes loves true feelings appear.<br />
I hope I can come close to rejuvenating the healthy happiness like you could get from doing yoga,<br />
wouldn't it be great if everyone behaved like a sofa?<br />
