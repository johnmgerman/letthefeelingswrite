Even though I do not glare,<br />
my thoughts and feelings are there because I care.<br />
Although we may not know each other very well or at all,<br />
my heart would like to help remove or to get negativity to withdrawl.<br />
So when your ears listen to what I have from within,<br />
it's so you understand you aren't peoples perverted bowling pin.<br />
So here I go, as if I had done the dirty deed,<br />
because I care enough to know this may be a part of what you need.<br />
The love you are deserves every ounce of respect and kindness like the feeling of a cool gentle breeze,<br />
so from the bottom of my heart, for those who can't or won't, please accept my most heartfelt, humble apologies.<br />
