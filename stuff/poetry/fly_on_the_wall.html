Here I sit, stuck on a wall,<br />
sitting if you may, looking around.<br />
Humans, humans, all over,<br />
why do they do what they do?<br />
all that food, they throw away,<br />
what a waste,<br />
if I could have just a little,<br />
taste.<br />
Forever I could eat it,<br />
I would, I could,<br />
why waste such a taste?<br />
<br /><br />
Now, out of nowhere,<br />
one approaches.<br />
They come at me with such anger,<br />
and haste.<br />
Why do they look at me with such,<br />
great distaste?<br />
I sit on a wall doing nothing,<br />
all I mentioned was food,<br />
What a waste for such lovely taste.<br />
Here they come with such anger,<br />
why?<br />
Why do they do what they do!?! ...
