When you come to me, truth is what I always hope to give you,<br />
never a lie, as that is always something I hope not to.<br />
I am never here to embarrass you with whatever I tell,<br />
always respectful of you and that will always ring like a bell.<br />
I am one who will never, ever judge,<br />
when we are together, and you smile, it gives my heart a loving nudge.<br />
Any time you are welcome around anywhere,<br />
To weigh our thoughts, only between us we will share.<br />
For you, I will do whatever I can not to fail,<br />
wouldn't it be great if everyone behaved like a scale?<br />
