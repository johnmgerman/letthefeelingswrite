My mind flutters with thoughts<br />
as my heart sees the feelings<br />
with every sense of her.<br />
<br />
The loving seed was planted,<br />
as the flowering of my soul was<br />
watered with the visions of her.<br />
<br />
The nourishment of her smile<br />
shines down upon the soil<br />
of my being.<br />
<br />
The roots of love intertwine,<br />
budding to the unconditional<br />
eternity of us.<br />
<br />
As the leaves of life wither<br />
around us,<br />
the dampness of our love will<br />
be without drought.<br />
<br />
Time will forever stand<br />
just like the stem of our<br />
foreverness.<br />
