My mind thinks,<br />
my heart drinks.<br />
<br />
Love sees through the eye,<br />
serenity replenishes us through a cry.<br />
<br />
Feeling through the soulfulness,<br />
eternities unending bliss.<br />
<br />
Heartfelt flames twinkle with a flick,<br />
times unconditionalness sounds silently with a tick.<br />
<br />
Each scent lives wtihin the fragrance of our foreverness,<br />
compassionately infinite, flowing through the breadth of life's kiss.<br />
<br />
Thoughts embrace positiveness's warmful hug,<br />
life's mindful blanket with melodic lyrics remaining inwardly snug.<br />
<br />
My, yours, us unending happiness hides within,<br />
life, you, all, the belief in, the belief of a never-failing win-win.<br />
