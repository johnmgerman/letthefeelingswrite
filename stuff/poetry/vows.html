Something happened the moment my eyes found you;<br />
the awakening of my heart forever became anew.<br />
<br />
A smile of pure beauty grasped my mind;<br />
encapsulated within an adorable silliness,<br />
my goodness what a find.<br />
<br />
When I look at you here, I see you the same way I did from day one;<br />
A feeling I never knew I thought or wanted,<br />
my life a cold winters day and you my rising sun.<br />
<br />
A gentle warmth swept through and graced my life;<br />
it was always one or nothing and with you I found my one and only wife.<br />
<br />
The words of how I feel for you could never match the love I feel for you;<br />
every second of our lives will be another second to honor you with - I do.<br />
<br />
My heart just says thank you and you don't need to do anything then just be;<br />
I thought throughout life I was happy, until one glance towards you made me feel truly free.<br />
<br />
I could stand here for hours expressing my love for you in every humanly possible way;<br />
but I will thank you for eternity showing you that my unconditional love for you will last for forever and a day.<br />
<br />
You will forever be my forever and a day.<br />
