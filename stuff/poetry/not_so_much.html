Hands touch, not so much.<br />
Body senses, shouldn't need the defenses.<br />
A glance, a look, that's all that should be took.<br />
Let their feelings remain, refrain from bringing about pain.<br />
Their taste of a happy life, don't disgard it with wasteful strife.<br />
An unpleasant behavioral scent, don't allow it to be a fragrance of discontent.<br />
Bring about the urge to repent, to eliviate for all and anymore torment.
