What would I do in a<br />
world without you?<br />
<br />
In a world that should be clean,<br />
only filth would be seen.<br />
<br />
What would it do if you weren't, here,<br />
everything would seem so far, nothing<br />
would be near.<br />
<br />
Everything I see, and all that is around<br />
in a world without you, it would seem<br />
like it has no sound.<br />
<br />
What would I do,<br />
what would life be like,<br />
in a world without you?<br />
<br />
It would be like stretching my hand out,<br />
with no other hands to be found.<br />
<br />
Like a pitcher, with no other players around,<br />
alone at the mound.<br />
<br />
It would be like a grocery story,<br />
with absolutely no food.<br />
<br />
Like living in paradise, but<br />
always in an unhappy mood.<br />
<br />
What would I do in a<br />
world without you?<br />
<br />
What would I do ...<br />
What would life be like ...<br />
I wouldn't want to know ...<br />
in a world without you.
