Violets sing, greens bloom.<br />
yellows shine, blues calm.<br />
reds love, browns natural.<br />
white cleanliness, black elegance.<br />
Colors of our existence<br />
of what we could be.<br />
The love of the song of our hearts.<br />
The shine of our elegance.<br />
The natural calm of our thoughts.<br />
The cleanliness of our souls as we bloom into the newness of forever.<br />
May we green with violets.<br />
May we yellow with blues.<br />
May we find brown reds.<br />
And may the white of our eternity always be black.<br />
May the trueness of ourselves<br />
colorfully find its way out.<br />
