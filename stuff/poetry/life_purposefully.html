Each sense of our hearts becomes an element of our thoughts:<br />
Love is all that we know we can see,<br />
to be, what we feel makes us free.<br />
To have, to know, that's what helps us become our own rooted tree.<br />
Compassion helps us to do what becomes our own and others greatest company,<br />
finding from within what we and others sense to decree.<br />
To become as beneficial as the herbal elements of tea,<br />
to become as helpful from within and without as vast as the sea,<br />
and to have the fragrance of our life become our own popeperee.<br />
Our hearts would sing like we are in the open fields of do ray mi,<br />
shape shifting ourselves into a loving, expressive oragami.<br />
Thoughtfully embraces into life's triumphant symphony.<br />
An existence that was meant to imprint ourselves in it completely,<br />
as we take our bow as if every moment was a part of our daily finale.<br />
Living within the climatic cinema of our own movie,<br />
emotionally bestowing through actions onto others, magnificently.<br />
A life lived through the eyes of eternity,<br />
an eternity lived through the life of our own story - <br />
a life purposefully done to become each other's own infinity.<br />
