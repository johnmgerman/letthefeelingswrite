A leaf, a leaf,<br />
of various colors,<br />
like a rainbow of a leaf.<br />
all around the outside,<br />
all looking different,<br />
as if the leaf was combined from every other leaf.<br />
Where did it come from?<br />
How did it become one?<br />
<br />
Colors mesh,<br />
mysteriously artistic,<br />
patterned exquisitely.<br />
<br />
Like an object from heaven,<br />
so different, so pure.<br />
Combing everything,<br />
all things.<br />
Amazingly,<br />
no matter the differences,<br />
in every section,<br />
the leaf is whole.<br />
Everything about it,<br />
everything within it,<br />
everything surrounding it,<br />
is harmonious.<br />
A mysterious leaf,<br />
mysteriously without blemish.
