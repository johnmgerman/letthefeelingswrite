Powerful struggle, within ourselves.<br />
The more some rise, the more some fall from within.<br />
Chaos ensues that no one sees.<br />
Rising tides erode the shorelines of our core.<br />
Inner thoughts due seem to corrupt.<br />
When power rises beyond repair.<br />
Our values soon become undone,<br />
then we all are all that we are not.<br />
Doing all that we never thought our minds would see.<br />
<br />
But why do we not feel this happen?<br />
Why is it no one notices when they fall?<br />
The sight of who we are is no longer seen.<br />
But what if we could see ourselves?<br />
Would we like ourselves?<br />
If others could feel that fall from within,<br />
would we still allow ourselves to fall as far?<br />
<br />
The questions that never show.<br />
The thoughts we never have.<br />
But what if we did?<br />
What if we had?<br />
Would you still allow yourself to fall from being you?<br />
