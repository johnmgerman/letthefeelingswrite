As the wars rage on,<br />
and the storms surround my life,<br />
if that emant you were safe,<br />
and you are sound,<br />
I wouldn't have changed that<br />
for anything, nowing you have<br />
a smile on your face and in your<br />
soul.<br />
<br />
Thank God you weren't around.<br />
<br />
While life continues to try and rip apart<br />
everything I say and do, knowing<br />
that eternal peace surrounds <br />
you and within, brings me more earthly<br />
joy and happiness within my soul<br />
that no money could ever replace.<br />
<br />
Thank God you weren't around.<br />
<br />
I know that sounds odd and<br />
most probably won't understand,<br />
but your happiness to me means<br />
everything even if that means<br />
I can't have much of anything.<br />
<br />
Unconditional love isn't about<br />
physical closeness, that's why<br />
I can say, even though strange, ...<br />
<br />
Thank God you weren't around.<br />
<br />
The wars raged on, the storms<br />
thundered, but knowing you were<br />
safe and sound, peace<br />
all around ...<br />
<br />
Thank God you weren't around.
