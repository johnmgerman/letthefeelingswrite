The waves of the mind come crashing,<br />
as the thoughts of you come flooding through.<br />
Happily restless,<br />
Mindfully blistfull,<br />
How enchanting the world is with those thoughts rippling around.<br />
<br />
Never dissipating, unwavering like time crossing the ocean.<br />
The winds of thoughts sail with you.<br />
Times, days, seasons circulating around each other.<br />
Mind, spirit, soul floating through the winds of thoughts.<br />
<br />
Exquisitely deserted,<br />
replenished through the oasis of your soul.<br />
Grand ocean of memories,<br />
reaching further then any depth.<br />
<br />
Beautifully serene,<br />
swimming through tranquility.
