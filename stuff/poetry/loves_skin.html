When I see the life of our love begin,<br />
it's another day of eternal win.<br />
<br />
As the stars brightly shine from within,<br />
forever soulfulness does it pin.<br />
<br />
All that we know and all that we feel,<br />
the heartfulness does know the unconditional deal.<br />
<br />
As our love does take a bowful kneel,<br />
each day I let our soulful flame take the wheel.<br />
<br />
Sippin on our soulful togetherness can make us heal,<br />
peal each negativity and leave it to where it has been.<br />
<br />
Grin inside as our love becomes real,<br />
steal away another moment from within the gentleness of loves skin.<br />
