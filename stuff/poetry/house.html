I'll be here to help provide for as long as you need,<br />
I'll stand by you and there will never be a need to plead.<br />
Day after day, my protection will be there,<br />
to protect all that you do care.<br />
Storms of life, will be my duty so they never directly hit,<br />
The safety of you, I will do my best, to never quit.<br />
So feel free to live without much worry,<br />
I'll cover you from every single flurry.<br />
Just think of us, together, like I am a forever loyal spouse,<br />
wouldn't it be great if everyone behaved like a house?<br />
