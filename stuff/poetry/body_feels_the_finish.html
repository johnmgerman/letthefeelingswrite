palms sweating,<br />
heart beating,<br />
marathon like pace.<br />
<br />
Minds thinking of the end,<br />
wandering towards the end,<br />
wishing for the end.<br />
<br />
Time never seems to turn.<br />
Seconds feel liek hours.<br />
<br />
This marathon,<br />
never ending,<br />
distance seems to go further.<br />
<br />
Body wanting to scream,<br />
minds ready to give up,<br />
but never giving up.<br />
Rushing forward,<br />
pushing towards the finish.<br />
<br />
Minds read yfor the finish,<br />
deep breaths cross the line.<br />
Minds feel the finish,<br />
bodies feel the finish,<br />
palms like a swamp.<br />
<br />
Heart racing back to normal.<br />
The race,<br />
the marathon ...<br />
finished.<br />
<br />
My running partner ... <br />
anxiety.<br />
