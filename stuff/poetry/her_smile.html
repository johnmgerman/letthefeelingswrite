Her smile was like looking<br />
into the glimpse of eternity.<br />
A guiding and shining light<br />
glowing from the suns warmth.<br />
All gloominess gone,<br />
the moment she smiles.<br />
Happiness and pure joy<br />
engulf our spirit,<br />
the moment her smile<br />
arrives.<br />
That moment forever lasting,<br />
that moment forever shining.<br />
A smile, her smile ...<br />
if only everyone could<br />
feel her smile.<br />
