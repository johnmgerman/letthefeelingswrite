(singing)<br />
Lyin' on the road again<br />
Just can't believe I'm back on the road again<br />
The life I love is helping my friends<br />
<br />
but I can't believe I'm back lyin' on the road again.<br />
Lyin' on the road again.<br />
<br />
Ain't goin places that I've never been<br />
Seein' things that I've seen over and over again.<br />
<br />
And I can't believe I'm lyin on the road again,<br />
lyin' on the road again.<br />
Like an unending battle we never make it down the highway<br />
Ain't feelin like the best of friends<br />
Insisting that me and my pages turn away.<br />
<br />
And turn away<br />
is lyin' on the road again.<br />
Just can't believe I'm back lyin' on the road again.<br />
The life I love is helping my friends<br />
<br />
And hopefully we can get back on the road again.<br />
<br />
Instead of lyin' back on the road again.<br />
<br />

It's a way to express, in a parody sense, that we can unintentionally or intentionally leave ourselves and others on the road again of life<br />
and no matter how many times we leave ourselves there,<br />
that we can rejoin ourselves and others back on the highway of life again.<br />
