The sinful life, at times, seems blissful to some,<br />
suppressing enslavement of feelings till their numb.<br />
Do right, do wrong, who cares if there are no lines of division,<br />
No right, no wrong, who cares about a decision.<br />
<br />
What do we do next?  What do we do now?  What does it matter?<br />
Right, wrong, sin - any goodness or wholesomeness, unknowingly, you do shatter.<br />
This life of sin seems like a life of pure joy,<br />
That is until the suppressed feelings, creep out from within, indirectly, ripping apart things they enjoy.<br />
<br />
Would they know? no.  Would they care? no.<br />
Ignorantly joyous though from within they are so low.<br />
Happily unhappy, unknowingly knowing.<br />
A sprinkle here, a sprinkle there ... their misery starts showing.<br />
<br />
What could they change?  What could they do?<br />
To bring that eternal joy to bring them anew.<br />
More sinful behavior, more sinful ways,<br />
all that would do is bring more lows for forever days.<br />
<br />
What could it be to bring the state of their life to unconditional love?<br />
Change their view, redirect their view, to the eternal sunshine of peace that comes from above.<br />
As the eternal flood rushes in, the feelings of change may make you uneasy as if they were wrong,<br />
but as the waters run through, washing away the lows, unconditional love appears<br />
like the glorious rays of sunshine of feelings from a song.<br />
<br />
Feelings sprout in all locations, and scenarios,<br />
love, manifesting from within, almost as if the love of light shows.<br />
No more sadness, no more lows,<br />
the eternal flood of love happily knows.<br />
<br />
Eyes fixated above,<br />
You'll finally be able to know,<br />
you'll finally be able to feel,<br />
you'll finally be able to spread ...<br />
unconditional love.
