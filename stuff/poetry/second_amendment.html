Our second amendment seems,<br />
to be quite clear.<br />
A well regulated militia seems to be,<br />
something some fear.<br />
Some words seem to be taken out,<br />
as if they don't exist.<br />
Others remain within their mind,<br />
to stay within their memories list.<br />
The security of a free state,<br />
what does that even mean?<br />
Guns, guns everywhere,<br />
shooting and killing anything that can be seen?<br />
One thing people seem to remember,<br />
is the right to bear arms,<br />
but what happens to the security of a free state,<br />
when chaos ensues sounding the alarms?<br />
Take all or take nothing,<br />
that's how it should be.<br />
Where is the insurance,<br />
of domestic tranquility,<br />
when mass shootings,<br />
cause people to flee?<br />
Understand what is written,<br />
to understand everyone's rights.<br />
The right to be arms,<br />
just like the right<br />
to not be focused through,<br />
a mass shooters sights.
