A shape of someone becomes a part of them,<br />
the work put in can make them feel and shine like a gem.<br />
As if they were a painting or a sculpture of their own,<br />
their dedication exposed through what their bodies have shown.<br />
But their committment isn't for perverted eyes to glare,<br />
nor to have devilish appetites to become aware.<br />
To be admired by some for the passion they put in, they may like,<br />
a healthiness from within, from warmful thoughts that help feel goods spike.<br />
Their body is just a part of their own existence,<br />
from within, emotions are thre, so do what you can to help life's positive rinse.<br />
We all have a body, jsut some put in more of the time,<br />
let's not push out any negativity like their dedication is some sort of punishable crime.<br />
