A total solar eclipse in its totality,<br />
brings on a sense of neutrality<br />
as the moon dims the sun,<br />
human kind, kind of becomes one.<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
Why does something so simple have such an affect?<br />
Something so grand, something so magnificent,<br />
allows people to come out of their shells and just be.<br />
<br />
The universe's conscience,<br />
bringing the planets together aligned.<br />
Is it something spiritual?<br />
Is it something far greater than humans know?<br />
To bring humans together, in such a way, almost as if they all had one mind.<br />
<br />
Through all the chaos and negative hate,<br />
is there something the universe knows that humans don't?<br />
All together, random people, from various walks of life ...<br />
one event, no hate, no negativity, no chaos,<br />
just a peaceful gathering of one little, yet significant, celestial event.
