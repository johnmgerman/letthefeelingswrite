Time passes,<br />
hunger remains.<br />
People pass by,<br />
full as can be.<br />
I ate just a little,<br />
my hunger remains.<br />
Their hunger?<br />
Do they even have hunger?<br />
All day,<br />
my hunger remains.<br />
All day,<br />
their hunger never exists.<br />
<br />
Would they know?<br />
Would they care?<br />
If they had to feel hunger,<br />
all day long?<br />
Is there a way to <br />
know that feeling<br />
without feeling<br />
that feeling?<br />
Maybe then,<br />
thought I wouldn't want them to,<br />
maybe then...<br />
<br />
If all, everyone,<br />
could do just a little.<br />
Just like I, others,<br />
ate just a little.<br />
<br />
Everyone, everywhere,<br />
who have just a little,<br />
wouldn't have to eat<br />
just a little.<br />
Everyone, everywhere,<br />
as time passes,<br />
hunger wouldn't remain.
