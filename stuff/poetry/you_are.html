Whenenver you are around,<br />
no matter the weather,<br />
the sun shines.<br />
<br />
No matter my mood,<br />
your smile,<br />
your laughter,<br />
brings me happiness.<br />
When life seems to be in<br />
total despair,<br />
you are my lifeline.<br />
<br />
Whenever I am hopelessly lost,<br />
you are the one who finds me.<br />
<br />
That's why your life completes me.<br />
You don't even need to be around,<br />
you don't even need to be near,<br />
you don't even need to know ...<br />
<br />
Just so you know, always, within my heart<br />
you will always be near.<br />
You are my sun...<br />
You are my laughter...<br />
You are my completion.
