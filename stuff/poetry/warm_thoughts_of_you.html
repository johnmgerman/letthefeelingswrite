Warmer weather, more fun in the sun,<br />
warmer people is who I'll be around.<br />
<br />
Warmer weather, happier times,<br />
Just like the thoughts of you,<br />
crosses my mind.<br />
<br />
Like sitting on the beach, toes in the sand,<br />
Watching thoughts of you race by - never makes life bland.<br />
<br />
Like the crashing of the waves, what a soothing sound,<br />
Your love, in my heart, in my thoughts, is where I've drownd.<br />
<br />
Warmer weather, happier times,<br />
warmer weather, like the thoughts of you going by.<br />
<br />
Warmer weather,<br />
warm thoughts of you,<br />
warmer weather,<br />
always warm thoughts of you.
