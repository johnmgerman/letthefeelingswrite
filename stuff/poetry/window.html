My eyes are here for you to view,<br />
to help see life within the coziness of our together's true-view.<br />
To open life and bring it to you,<br />
so the moments of life can last forever through.<br />
Also to try to protect from anything around,<br />
with me, a friend is what I hope you feel you have found.<br />
And even when I fade behind the shades of your thoughts,<br />
my help for you will always be in the front of my forethoughts.<br />
Enjoy your time like a little kid playing a game from nintendo,<br />
wouldn't it be great if everyone behavled like a window?<br />
