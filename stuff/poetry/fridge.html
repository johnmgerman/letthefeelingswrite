If there is something you want to keep for another time,
I'll do whatever I can to keep it sublime.
Faith in myself is what you can feel,
within myself, I'll do whatever I can to help you deal.
Like a refreshing shower after a long day,
I'll try to help everything you have feel the same way.
No matter the time or within the night,
I'll make sure to never lose anything out from my sight.
So feel free to come to me even if for only a smidge,
wouldn't it be great if everyone behaved like a fridge?
