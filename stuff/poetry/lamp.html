I am here to help light up your life,<br />
like I am a figurative second wife.<br />
but never to replace the love you feel,<br />
only to help illuminate so the darkness may never conceal.<br />
Even when my precense isn't currently glowing,<br />
Forever, internally, my help is always showing.<br />
I'll be there quicker than a flip of a switch,<br />
even faster than a baseball player's pitch.<br />
We both, with each other, will ligthen life's ramp,<br />
wouldn't it be great if we all behaved like a lamp?<br />
