I'm here to reflect all of you,<br />
even if the seconds, at times, are only a few.<br />
When you can't see all of your true self,<br />
look deep within me, to find the beauty hidden behind your life's shelf.<br />
It's almost as if you and I stand the same,<br />
and never from me will you ever get an ounce of shame.<br />
If you so desire, talk your hearts content,<br />
as I'm even here to listen, which can be in itself a compliment.<br />
And just know, I'll always be here to do what I can to help you see yourself clearer,<br />
wouldn't it be great if everyone behaved like a mirror?<br />
