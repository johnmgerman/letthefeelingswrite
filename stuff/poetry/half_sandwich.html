Half the fullness that we feel, could we use part of that to help someone else's hunger heal?<br />
When the smell seeps out from the food, wouldn't youu like to know, it could help anothers mood?<br />
When we see what we can do, their and our lives, become anew.<br />
Knowing our lives go beyond our own, can help us become what we have never been shown.<br />
Take a second, take a new view, to help someone else, who underneath is just like you too.<br />
A sandwich for one, can be split into two, to become hunger's foreverness undone.<br />
