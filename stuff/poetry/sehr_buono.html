All that we are is tutti that we all are.<br />
Each person, ogni place, all differently the same.<br />
Auge colors different, but the stessa.<br />
Stimme tones different, but the same.<br />
Lingue different, but from within, gesprochen the same.<br />
When we know ourselves from within, we can know all from within.<br />
Each person.<br />
Every place.<br />
The language di ein.<br />
The bellezza of who we all are: mar mma, szep, schein, hermosa, bedew, kuhle.<br />
Individualistically schon within the masterpiece of all.<br />
We can, within, universally, achieve...<br />
