		  A sense of richness<br />
fills my mind,<br />
money anywhere<br />
one could find.<br />
<br />
Never a day<br />
to ever remind,<br />
the possibility<br />
of getting behind.<br />
<br />
An extra sense<br />
of wealth assigned,<br />
a money detector,<br />
a sense defined.<br />
<br />
Lustful pursuits<br />
always declined,<br />
gratefulness and gratitude<br />
become aligned.<br />
<br />
A purity,<br />
of the gentle kind,<br />
extravagant wealth,<br />
to help mankind.<br />
