Houses going down,<br />
foreclosures setting in.<br />
Mind blissfully gleeful,<br />
a smile on the soul.<br />
<br />
Complaints and gripes nowhere around,<br />
insanity must have set in,<br />
complaints should be flourishing.<br />
How could?  How would?  How should this be?<br />
So joyous, so painlessly content ...<br />
with content supposedly so painful.<br />
<br />
Eyes must be set on something out of this world,<br />
while grace sets within the heart.<br />
<br />
Others watch in complete wonder,<br />
"shouldn't this person be angry?", "shouldn't this person be ticked?",<br />
"but this person isn't? ... who is this?",<br />
whispers of wonder, "is this even human?".<br />
<br />
Truthfulness and honesty that's all there is,<br />
complaints and gripes flush down into the abyss.<br />
Whispers and wonders turn to,<br />
astonishment and amazement.<br />
<br />
Inspiration glows from within,<br />
inspiration through hardship,<br />
inspiring others without a dash of pity.<br />
<br />
Hardships don't feel like such hardships,<br />
when inspiration helps to set grace within the heart.
