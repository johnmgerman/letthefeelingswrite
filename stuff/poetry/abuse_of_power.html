Pow, pow, power wheels<br />
of the mind<br />
turning faster with greed.<br />
A life growing from within<br />
that fogs the outside world.<br />
A dryness of emotions<br />
corroding the soul.<br />
Sunshine darkens<br />
with the gloom of a storm,<br />
sprinkling of a smile<br />
hidden behind;<br />
but a smile...<br />
that's nowhere<br />
to be found<br />
in the heart.<br />
A power that makes<br />
you feel powerful,<br />
but a power<br />
that you can lose yourself<br />
from within.<br />
Do they even know?<br />
Can they even see it happening?<br />
<br />
When we begin to abuse power,<br />
we begin to abuse<br />
our own existence,<br />
but no abuse can be felt,<br />
when it<br />
beings to have a feeling<br />
like being as high<br />
on a drug.<br />
Each moment<br />
you seek more.<br />
Each moment<br />
you yearn more.<br />
Addiction to power<br />
is more of what<br />
it should be called;<br />
which leads to abuse<br />
that helps the storm<br />
to never leave.<br />
<br />
That high keeps you<br />
delusionally happy<br />
as you corrupt from within.<br />
To understand the hurt<br />
and pain you cause<br />
from without;<br />
but does that thought<br />
ever cross the path<br />
of those you abuse?<br />
And the path<br />
from where it started<br />
to the one<br />
who you abuse the most -<br />
yourself?<br />
<br />
Abusing power<br />
is more than abuse -<br />
it's an addiction;<br />
that removes you<br />
and others<br />
who may have crossed<br />
your path,<br />
to living a life<br />
without ever having<br />
that storm rage.<br />
Abuse only happens<br />
when we allow<br />
an addiction to remain.<br />
<br />
So, become the lyrics<br />
that can help<br />
that storm race off to sea;<br />
and do what is best<br />
for you and others<br />
to finally free<br />
your mind<br />
so the rest can follow.<br />
