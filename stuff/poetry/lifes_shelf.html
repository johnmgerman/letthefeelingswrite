A book left on a shelf,<br />
sometimes that's how we feel.<br />
A history within ourselves,<br />
within a cover, no one looks to open.<br />
The ridges of our bindings may become<br />
worn and weathered.<br />
From the use of yesteryear,<br />
but a use, at times, no one looks for.<br /><br />
But that beauty remains within and without<br />
waiting to be discovered.<br />
A remembrance of a life read about<br />
and lived about from our life's shelf.<br />
The contents as important as when<br />
they were first lived.<br />
The cover as beautiful as when<br />
it was first bound together.<br />
Each day, a new day,<br />
like a seed sprouting with new life.<br />
A new scene, a new chapter<br />
awaiting to sprout anew.<br /><br />
No matter how long you<br />
remained on your life's shelf,<br />
no matter how worn the<br />
cover of your existence is,<br />
the beauty of the words in your<br />
life story can never be<br />
unwritten.<br />
Every day a reminder<br />
of the gentle beauty the<br />
story of your life was and is.<br />
Let the shelf of your life<br />
help you remember that<br />
you are always remembered,<br />
always wanted and that<br />
there is always a chance<br />
to open yourself back up<br />
to write more words in<br />
the story of your life.<br />
