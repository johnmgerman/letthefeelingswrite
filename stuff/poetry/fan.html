Although my existence seems to be drowned out by some,<br />
the refreshness I can give, I hope you always know where it comes from.<br />
If all else fails, the words of my help can always be ready to be there,<br />
watning to know that my help is always there because I care.<br />
We all have functions in life and this is a part of mine,<br />
and hopefully that refreshness helps you feel fine.<br />
I may not be as sophisticated as the others that do what I do,<br />
though I was there before them and you can continue to come find me if you ever need me too.<br />
So always remember my help for you will never become a ban,<br />
wouldn't it be great if everyone behaved like a fan?<br />
