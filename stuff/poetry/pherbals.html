Two sides of an isle, sometimes or always, never seem to want to meet,<br />
both sides doing something good, but never wanting to unend the tensions heat.<br />
A mind can begin to think it has all that we can be,<br />
but the path that can't be found, but could become all that we need, undeniably.<br />
An earth that was built for humains to remain,<br />
medicines galore, helping, at times, the human body to sustain.<br />
With spices abundant that can do what medicines can do as well,<br />
pick and choose, intertwine, a world of show and tell.<br />
Herbs and medicines should become one family,<br />
an extensive one at that, which are everywhere abundantly.<br />
If only all could see the good they both can do,<br />
competition would cease, andd the world could know the reality of what's true.<br />
Doctors and herbalists can be the same even if they don't know,<br />
when both decide to marry, what a pherbal life that could grow.<br />
