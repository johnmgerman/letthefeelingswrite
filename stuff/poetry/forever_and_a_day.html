Joys can be temporary,<br />
laughter can subside,<br />
but the thoughts of you<br />
last for forever and<br />
a day.<br />
<br />
Winds dissipate here<br />
and there.<br />
Storms rage, and<br />
storms calm,<br />
but the thoughts of you<br />
last for forever and<br />
a day.<br />
<br />
A novels page has its<br />
limits,<br />
a movies time has its<br />
end,<br />
but the thoughts of you<br />
last for forever and<br />
a day.<br />
<br />
An existence without a <br />
single thought of you<br />
would be one of life's<br />
greatest tragedies,<br />
but thankfully due to you<br />
that tragedy remains unwritten,<br />
as the thoughts of you<br />
last for forever and<br />
a day.<br />
