Here I sat,<br />
from within,<br />
in darkness.<br />
Nothing around to light,<br />
my shaded soul.<br />
Shading for nothing,<br />
shading, shading,<br />
shade.<br />
That's all I have<br />
empty shading.<br />
<br />
Here I sit,<br />
nothing,<br />
pointlessly unable<br />
to brighten anything.<br />
My purpose,<br />
where is it?<br />
Unable to brighten,<br />
to lighten,<br />
to shine,<br />
anything, anywhere.<br />
I can't even brighten<br />
the darkness of my life.<br />
The darkness, the darkness ...<br />
that's all.<br />
<br />
What is happening?<br />
What is going on?<br />
I'm being placed in<br />
more darkness?<br />
darkness?  darkness?<br />
I already have darkness,<br />
why more darkness?<br />
<br />
But then all of a sudden,<br />
a feeling,<br />
an inner feeling,<br />
a pure glow ...<br />
joy erupting,<br />
shining from within,<br />
the shade no longer dark.<br />
I no longer dark.<br />
<br />
My shaded soul,<br />
no longer empty shading.<br />
My glowing soul,<br />
shining within,<br />
shining around.<br />
one little thing,<br />
everything,<br />
changed everything.<br />
Turned my empty shade<br />
into something ...<br />
<br />
That glow, that shade,<br />
what a calming from<br />
within ...<br />
my light from within<br />
glows silently<br />
under and around<br />
the empty shade<br />
that is no longer.<br />
<br />
That light,<br />
that shade,<br />
everything just,<br />
everything ...<br />
without that shade,<br />
I am just a darkened light.<br />
Without that light,<br />
I am just an empty shade.<br />
Together, forever,<br />
we are brightly,<br />
and shadly ...<br />
a lamp.
