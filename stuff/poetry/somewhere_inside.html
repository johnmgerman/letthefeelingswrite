somewhere inside,<br />
softly glowing,<br />
is who we are<br />
hidden from anyone to notice.<br />
Somewhere inside,<br />
softly unheard,<br />
softly unseen,<br />
somewhere not found by others.<br />
<br />
Somewhere inside,<br />
is who we are,<br />
how others get to know,<br />
and feel that soft glow.<br />
Somewhere inside,<br />
is how we feel.<br />
Somewhere inside,<br />
is how we make others feel.<br />
Somewhere inside,<br />
is how everything feels.<br />
<br />
Somewhere inside,<br />
is who we are.<br />
Somewhere inside,<br />
is how everything is.<br />
Somewhere inside,<br />
is what everything is ...<br />
somewhere inside,<br />
softly glowing,<br />
is who we, everything, are ...<br />
somewhere inside.
