As time passes,<br />
our lives intertwine with our souls.<br />
You, I, eternity.<br />
Everything that was, is,<br />
and everything that was never, will be.<br />
Everything that did, will.<br />
everything that didn't, shall.<br />
Waltzing through life,<br />
spiritually embracing.<br />
A date will be,<br />
a date shall come,<br />
a date we've had,<br />
a date that shall embrace our lives.<br />
A date of foreverness,<br />
a date of togetherness.<br />
A date,<br />
one date,<br />
a date ...<br />
We've had this date with each other <br />
from the beginning.
