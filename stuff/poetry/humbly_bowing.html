Sometimes I look through the eyes of the darkness,<br />
rushing through the ocean of rippling stars.<br />
<br />
Eyes of the universe blinking with the hint of day,<br />
my mind blistfully unaware of the vastness that I see.<br />
<br />
Riding the tracks of the path of this planet,<br />
I gaze out of the greatest looking glass called earth.<br />
<br />
You barely see anything, but you see all of everything,<br />
a spec of life in the body of the universe.<br />
<br />
Humbly bowing to the sights up above,<br />
gloriously feeling the humility of the views of the eyes<br /> 
from within each other.
