When the right man looks at you,<br />
he'll see the world.<br />
Not just what is on the surface,<br />
all of, everything, that makes up who you are.<br />
<br />
He won't see anything else.<br />
Everything will fade,<br />
all all that will be left,<br />
is the star light of his universe.<br />
<br />
When the right man looks at you,<br />
the life he always wanted starts.<br />
<br />
When the right man looks at you,<br />
the life he always wanted never ends.<br />
<br />
When the right man looks at you.<br />
When the right man look at you,<br />
everything that was no longer is,<br />
and his forever, now and will<br />
alawys be his forever ...<br />
<br />
When the right man looks at you.
