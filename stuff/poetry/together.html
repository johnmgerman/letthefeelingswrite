A competition does not need to be.<br />
A fact, at times, that humans do not see.<br />
Inside themselves, they might think what they know is more true,<br />
but what they find within each other, they might find more of what they think too.<br />
When we allow ourselves to think only of what we know,<br />
our own stubborness becomes our own intellects foe.<br />
When we allow ourselves to intertwine and all we know become one,<br />
the warmth we can give out comes from our own inner sun.<br />
Let go of what you think and become what we can find,<br />
as we all, together, illuminate the future of mankind.<br />
