If you look at women like Katharine McPhee, they are engaging and dating men twice their age instead of boys who are perverted in their sexual desires to view women as only such.  Men who actually look at them; not just for who they are on the outside, but all of who they are.  Intimately loving them, as a whole, not waht they feel that the ycan get from them, themselves.<br />
<br />
It's interesting when you dive within the word manhood itself,  you will find the phrase, "sexual potency"; society indwells within the word and guys alike, almost uplifting as if sex is the foundation of manhood. Without sex, how could you ever be a man?<br />
<br />
But would the same people that they want to be intimate with, feel the same about these guys sexual potency? The word intimate was used as intimacy is what a lof of women look for;  and intimacy isn't just what manhood defines within it... and a lot of the times a lot more. Various sections reside within the word.<br />
<br />
Let us count the ways:<br />
<br />
1. Emotional - to love beyond the physical realm;  to love someone for who all they are.  To know it's them you love, not parts of them.  When you see them smile, your heart smiles.  When you see them sad, your heart saddens.  The emotionalness of you connects with thet emotionalness of them.<br />
<br />
2. Communicative - women love to talk and listen;  and they love for you to know what about what they have to say, about anything.  Listening is a great way to show someone you truly care about them.<br />
<br />
3. Physical - nonsexual - what better way to be physically intimate then the massage;  women love massages as do many people.  This doesn't need to be a professional massage, but a loving, sensual massage.  Cuddling up <br />
next to them on the .  Walking up behind, unscheduled, to give them a loving embrace.  Various ways to how physical intimacy that will bring you closer to the women you love.<br />
<br />
4. Thoughtful - Make any day a birthday or valentines;  it doesn't need to be as grand as you might do for those days potentially, but just to do things here and there.  A random gift or a random love note they wouldn't think to happen. Like a random note on a mirror in a bathroom or such, "Even on the gloomiest of days, you are my forever sunshine.". Sometimes in life, the little things can be remembered as the big things.<br />
<br />
When you truly love someone, why not do the things for them that they truly love?  Why resist the love you can
give to someone you love?<br />

Maybe it's time to redefine manhood...<br />
