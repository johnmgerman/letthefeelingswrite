If there was a way to keep time<br />
standing still,<br />
just to see you,<br />
let it freeze forever.<br />
<br />
If the skies of life forever remain a storm,<br />
just to see you,<br />
then let it rage.<br />
<br />
If all the riches in life meant<br />
no sight of you,<br />
then forever let me be poor.<br />
<br />
If the bounty of food was always full,<br />
but without the fullness of the<br />
visions of you,<br />
then forever let the bounty be scarce.<br />
<br />
But the one thing<br />
that can keep time from freezing,<br />
the skies of life from forever raging,<br />
the riches in life from ever becoming poor,<br />
and the bounty of food from ever becoming<br />
scarce,<br />
would just be ... by seeing you.<br />
<br />
No matter which way life goes.<br />
time frozen, time not.<br />
Skies raging, skies not.<br />
Life wouldn't be life<br />
without the vision of you.<br />
