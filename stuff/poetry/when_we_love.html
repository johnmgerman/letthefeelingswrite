When we feel love, we can see love.<br />
When we see love, we can become love.<br />
When we become love, we intertwine ourselves as if we are love.<br />
When we intertwine with love, love opens itself to more then we know.<br />
When we become more then we knwo. all that we thought fades to all that we know didn't.<br />
When we finally know love, love lets us finally know ourselves.<br />
When we know ourselves, we know we've become not just the knowledge of love - but we become love.<br />
When we love, when we allow love to love us...<br />
Love openheartedly vitalizes emotions.<br />
