Rain drops glisten,<br />
natures listen.<br />
hearts beating,<br />
loves first meeting.<br />
<br />
Souls combine,<br />
on eternities line.<br />
<br />
Forever flame,<br />
together, never the same.<br />
<br />
Quest for loves clock strikes rescind,<br />
unconditional love now pinned.<br />
<br />
2 to 1,<br />
glow of warmth like the sun.<br />
<br />
1 soul, 1 being,<br />
soulful hearts together seeing.<br />
<br />
To never extinguiish, to never fade,<br />
from the beginning, for each other,<br />
we were made.
