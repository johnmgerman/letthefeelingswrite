When I look into the sky,<br />
in the darkness of the night,<br />
such peacefulness,<br />
twinkled from up high.<br />
Wherever you look,<br />
Wherever you feel,<br />
a little bit of serenity,<br />
comes from up high.<br />
A stillness, a calmness,<br />
the purity of the night sky.<br />
A darkened blanket<br />
covers nature,<br />
twinkling with life.<br />
Tranquility breaths<br />
through the almost<br />
quietness of the night.<br />
Hushing nature's hustle<br />
to a mere silenced glow.<br />
Like a warm soothing song,<br />
the universes cozy blanket<br />
snuggled nature's existence<br />
for a refreshing good night.<br />
