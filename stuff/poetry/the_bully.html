Damaging words fly and slice<br />
through the air.<br />
Why do they do them, why do they care?<br />
They throw thetm around with uncaring flare.<br />
<br />
If they feel, they don't show.<br />
If they care, they seemingly don't know.<br />
Is it right?  Is it not?<br />
Should they continue?  No way, no how!<br />
<br />
But why do they hurt?<br />
Why do they say what they say?<br /><br />
Hurtful emotions from a hurtful person,
a hurtful person with emotional scars ...<br />
<br />
Could they try to hurt you to try<br />
to free themselves from the hurt they can't escape?<br />
Would it matter to you?<br />
Would it matter to them?<br />
<br />
It matters ... so if you can, remember ...<br />
<br />
Always remember the words<br />
that try to damage you,<br />
can come from a damaged place.<br />
<br />
The bully who tries to bully may<br />
also be bullied from within.<br />
You could just be the target of what they feel inside.
