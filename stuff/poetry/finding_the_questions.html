Do we see? do we know?<br />
loves vision, loves flow.<br />
<br />
When we give? what we can?<br />
what's written, compassions pen.<br />
<br />
When we look? what we be?<br />
humanely intertwined, rooted tree.<br />
<br />
Do we feel? do we become?<br />
mathematically equatable, infinite sum.<br />
<br />
Do we have? are we kind?,<br />
humanitarianism endless, limitless find.<br />
<br />
When we share? when we do?<br />
stenciled serenity, artistically drew.<br />
<br />
When we try? when we may?<br />
heavenliness abounds, mindfully pray.<br />
<br />
Do we believe? do we insight?<br />
heartfully beating, illuminated light.<br />
<br />
Time has sense, will we show,<br />
togetherness donated, charitable glow.<br />
