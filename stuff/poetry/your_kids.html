A laughter, a joy.<br />
A love so simple, yet deep.<br />
A child in our hearts,<br />
a family memeber forever known.<br />
<br />
Eyes forever changed,<br />
thoughts wanting more than you ever thought.<br />
Warmth forever uncooled,<br />
a comfort that never leaves our souls.<br />
<br />
A little child, of any age, that's not yours,<br />
but every sense is like they are.<br />
You can see yourself as them,<br />
unconditionalness knows through your heart to theirs.<br />
<br />
What would life be,<br />
if we could all see,<br />
like each other were ... your kids.<br />
