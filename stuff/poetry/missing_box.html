Hours pass, slower and slower.<br />
Time no longer moving.<br />
Desperately and anxiously pacing in my mind.<br />
What happened?Â  Where did it go?<br />
I need it, I can't live without it.<br />
Life wanting to rip it away, keep it away,<br />
nowhere near, make sure it stays afar.<br />
How desperately I've wanted it, how desperately I've need it,<br />
How desperately I feel like I will never have it.<br />
Like a story that never ends, calls, e-mails,<br />
continue without hope.<br />
Hope, what a word.<br />
Hope, does it still exist?<br />
Hope, where are you? Hope ... hello??<br />
Silence echoes through my mind,<br />
desperation fading.<br />
No one knows? ... how could no one know ...<br />
Hours stop, time no longer exists,<br />
seconds feel like years.<br />
Seconds. Feel. Like. Years ...<br />
A gentle knock, am I dreaming?<br />
A gentle knock, is it?<br />
No, it can't, or is it?<br />
Everything within my soul races towards it.<br />
Outside a woman, stands, eyes enchanting,<br />
hair flowing effortlessly like her beauty.<br />
All of life focuses on her, background fades.<br />
Without noticing within her hands, a box ... my box.<br />
Hope you showed, hope you answered!<br />
HOPE!!! ...<br />
but a different hope showed.<br />
The hope I never thought,<br />
The hope I never knew I couldn't live without.<br />
The hope in her eyes, the hope in her.<br />
In her hands is what I desperately needed,<br />
and no longer desperately want.<br />
I hope seconds feel like years with her.<br />
Without warning, without thinking, without wanting ...<br />
What's your name? ...
