War raging,<br />
fear embracing<br />
thoughts of what if?<br />
<br />
Fight or flight,<br />
fight or flight,<br />
like two cars racing back<br />
andd forth down the street.<br />
<br />
Turn away,<br />
just run,<br />
you don't need to,<br />
just choose flight.<br />
<br />
Thoughts giving in,<br />
body ready to run.<br />
<br />
But something stops,<br />
something gives,<br />
mind turns.<br />
<br />
Fear remains,<br />
fight or flight heightens.<br />
<br />
Body trembling from within,<br />
mind continuing to try to turn.<br />
<br />
War had begun,<br />
but the war was won.<br />
<br />
If they only knew,<br />
how difficult it was at times<br />
just to say ...<br />
hello.<br />
