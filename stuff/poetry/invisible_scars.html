A beating here, a beating there,<br />
scars, scars - everywhere.<br />
<br />
There lasting strikes seem to never fade,<br />
a beaten soul, forever made?<br />
<br />
Our minds, our bodies, are in tune,<br />
an understanding never comes too soon.<br />
<br />
When we give in to our hateful side,<br />
silent tears can never be heard to have cried.<br />
<br />
Mental scars may not be shown,<br />
from within, they can be forever known.<br />
<br />
Just because the scars can't be seen,<br />
doesnn't mean they can't be felt just as mean.<br />
<br />
Time though does give us to start anew,<br />
to brighten the days that were once blue.<br />
<br />
To change yourself, and change a letter,<br />
to help make the world all that much better.<br />
<br />
Twinkle, twinkle the invisible scars,<br />
what a wonder, filling our hearts with stars.<br />
<br />
When we know, what we can see,<br />
a different world, from within and without, will truly be set free.<br />
