If we had the spirit of a child,<br />
if we retained the spirit of a child,<br />
joyously curious,<br />
gleefully entertained,<br />
by anything,<br />
by nothing.<br />
<br />
Everywhere you look,<br />
everywhere you go,<br />
is an adventure.<br />
<br />
The view from the eye<br />
of a child's mind.<br />
How wonderfully<br />
simplistic,<br />
yet how mysteriously<br />
complex.<br />
<br />
If only adults could<br />
retain the view from<br />
the eye of a child's<br />
mind.<br />
Joyously curious,<br />
gleefully entertained<br />
from the view of<br />
the eye of their own<br />
childhood's mind.<br />
