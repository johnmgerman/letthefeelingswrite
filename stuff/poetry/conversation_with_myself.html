Here I sit,<br />
alone, outside in the world,<br />
minding my own business.<br />
bothering no one,<br />
having a conversation<br />
with myself.<br />
<br />
The odd looks,<br />
the strange eyes,<br />
all looking at me<br />
like I'm crazy.<br />
<br />
If I had this same<br />
conversation,<br />
within my mind<br />
barely anyone would notice,<br />
barely anyone would know.<br />
<br />
No odd looks,<br />
no strange eyes.<br />
No one would look at me,<br />
no one woul think I'm crazy.<br />
<br />
It seems odd,<br />
it seems strange,<br />
how they look at me,<br />
how they behave,<br />
What they think of me ...<br />
how they look.<br />
<br />
The same way,<br />
they think<br />
and look ...<br />
at me.<br />
