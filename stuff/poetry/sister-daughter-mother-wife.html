When you look at another, does the truth do show?<br />
to help you find the possibilities you may not know?<br />
Legs, a chest, that's all they can become,<br />
but can you not find where they are from?<br />
The thoughts of who they are, sometimes can not see,<br />
but if you did, you and them could be set truly free.<br />
Boys will be boys, what an interesting phrase,<br />
but would the thoughts be the same if it was someone you loved during those days?<br />
A wife, a daughter, a mother and a sister too,<br />
would your mind begin to find the puzzling clue?<br />
Anyone you find is like someone you love,<br />
with that, would your thoughts still be the same like someone you hold high above?<br />
Help your eyes know all that it very well could,<br />
so you and the world can be as peaceful as it should.<br />
So become what you can to help your mother and/or sister and/or daughter and/or wife,<br />
so them, and all, can live without any additional societal strife.<br />
