When we find ourselves,<br />
when we see ourselves,<br />
we then know ourselves.<br />
<br />
when we believe ourselves,<br />
when truth infiltrates ourselves,<br />
happiness lives within ourselves.<br />
<br />
When we sense ourselves,<br />
when we hear ourselves,<br />
we can become ourselves.<br />
<br />
If we face ourselves,<br />
we can overcome ourselves,<br />
to truly be ourselves.<br />
