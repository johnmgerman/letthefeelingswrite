Like a square to a circle,<br />
I don't fit.<br />
<br />
No matter how many are<br />
around, or who I can hear,<br />
I'm alone.<br />
<br />
Like a school with no children,<br />
or a pool with no water,<br />
everything seems unfullfilled.<br />
<br />
That is until the water reappears,<br />
the children gleefully rush in.<br />
Just a though, like a fantasy,<br />
of her,<br />
everything is fullfilled.<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter how many people<br />
aren't around.<br />
or who I can't hear,<br />
I'm never alone.<br />
<br />
No matter shape, no matter<br />
the size, I fit.<br />
Just the though, like a fantasy,<br />
of her ...<br />
I, her, everything ... fits.
