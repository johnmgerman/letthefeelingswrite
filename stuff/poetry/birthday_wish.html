Birthdays and wishes there they come,<br />
birthdays and wishes there they go.<br />
No matter the time,<br />
no matter the day,<br />
it's the same<br />
every year.<br />
The same just like others,<br />
the same just like holidays.<br />
The same but why<br />
not the same?<br />
without that birth,<br />
without that day,<br />
that person<br />
wouldn't be here,<br />
they wouldn't be anywhere.<br />
<br />
A wish, a birthday wish,<br />
a wish to celebrate<br />
the importance of the<br />
birth and the day.<br />
A day off to celebrate<br />
the importance of<br />
that person ... to<br />
celebrate them.<br />
A congrats, and<br />
thank you for<br />
solely and simply<br />
being them.<br />
A birthday wish<br />
for the birth and<br />
days ...<br />
So everyone can have<br />
a day, their day,<br />
to be honored, so to say,<br />
for their existence on this<br />
earth.<br />
A birthday wish for<br />
the birthdays.
