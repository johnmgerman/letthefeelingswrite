If/when you ever need, i'm always there.<br />
I'll help you carry anything you dare.<br />
Elements are secured from all that's around.<br />
I'll do all that I can to keep everything sound.<br />
Not a word will be spoken of what's inside,<br />
unless they unzipped my lips, I would never tell no matter how hard they tried.<br />
To me it doesn't matter about race, color or creed,<br />
I'll be hanging around, whenever you need.<br />
Straps to always cover and have your back.<br />
Wouldn't it be great if everyone behaved like a backpack.<br />
