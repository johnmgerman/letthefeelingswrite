The angelic beauty of paris,<br />
in its simplicity.<br />
Architecture of yesteryear,<br />
blooming in modern times.<br />
Rows and rows of the stillness,<br />
of love.<br />
Captured beautifully with,<br />
the atmosphere of Paris.<br />
<br />
Standing over like a guardian princess,<br />
emitting, from above, the purity of Paris's love.<br />
People, like the architecture,<br />
in their simplistic angelic beauty,<br />
all intertwined.<br />
<br />
Spiritually unconditional,<br />
exquisiteness never ending.<br />
The spirit of love,<br />
built in every building,<br />
in every person,<br />
in every part of life.<br />
<br />
The angelic beauty of Paris.<br />
The angelic beauty of its people.<br />
The angelic beauty of beauty ...<br />
The perfection of the purity of love.
