Within the darkness we can become our own bright, shiny star,<br />
instead of remaining our own life's scar.<br />
The truth to a better world lies within one another,<br />
to see each, as if, we were each others brother.<br />
Loving each other enough to show eacha other what to do,<br />
to bring up, so not a crowd could give a single boo.<br />
All throughout life we would help, as if we were the same,<br />
raining down to darken the darkened flame.<br />
With a heart that sees with the vision of all,<br />
so the truth within one another can help us overcome any wall.<br />
