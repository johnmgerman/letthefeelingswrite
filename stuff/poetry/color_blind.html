Your skin, my skin<br />
different colors, same skin.<br />
If we could only live from within<br />
instead of living from what<br />
we see without.<br />
A life filled with color<br />
but a life without the color.<br />
Eyes born to see the color,<br />
but not divide the color.<br />
May the colors of life blend together,<br />
so that all colors become one.<br />
So everyone can live through<br />
the lenses of a colorless<br />
society.<br />
