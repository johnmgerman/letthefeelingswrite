Everything I wear people look<br />
at me strangely.<br />
Everywhere I go they think<br />
of me oddly.<br />
Clean-cut, dressed to the nines,<br />
I'm an oddity.<br />
Their life is up.<br />
My life is down.<br />
Their look is what people want,<br />
my look is what people don't.<br />
On the outside their life seems to be,<br />
On any side my life seems to be ...<br />
That is,<br />
until,<br />
you look,<br />
within ...<br />
Happiness shines from within,<br />
their happiness erodes from within.<br />
Exterior hiding what lies deep,<br />
deep within me lies happiness.<br />
What an oddity,<br />
not just myself.<br />
what an oddity,
not all though ...<br />
not everyone,<br />
not all ...<br />
but some,<br />
maybe more, maybe less.<br />
Just like we can be more or less,<br />
no matter if we have more or less.<br />
Choose the more even if you have more.<br />
Choose the more even if you don't.<br />
Choose the more from within,<br />
to give you more,<br />
the more,<br />
from within.
