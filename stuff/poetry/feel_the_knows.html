Look, look, look,<br />
to all places that are shook, shook, shook.<br />
<br />
Whenever you find trouble,<br />
you might have allowed it to double.<br />
<br />
All that we once knew about a town,<br />
starts to bring about behavior that makes us frown.<br />
<br />
Lives, do people really care?<br />
When all society does is watch and stare.<br />
<br />
If we could feel all that we know,<br />
would society only watch the problems like it's a show?<br />
<br />
Psychologically speaking, we are doomeed when there is more,<br />
fingers do point, as problems surmount with an insatiable uproar.<br />
<br />
All that has happened, would we allow again all that we did?<br />
Or would we continue to pretend nothing happened, and keep ourselves hid?<br />
<br />
Humans are more then what they give,<br />
if only they knew that as they live.<br />
<br />
One day, maybe, life will get there,<br />
when people finally realize they can<br />
be each others breath of fresh air.<br />
