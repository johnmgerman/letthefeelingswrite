		  To the road to tomorrow approved by a sign.<br />
A thumbs up of life you haven't met.<br />
Quietly intertwining with the now in your mindset.<br />
Synchronization gears towards future's timeline.<br />
<br />
What was and what is meshed to align.<br />
Soon to be on a path preset.<br />
To the road to tomorrow approved by a sign.<br />
A thumbs up of life you haven't met.<br />
<br />
Waves crash upon the consciousness of the next shoreline,<br />
bringing about heavenly views through the passageway of tomorrow's sunset.<br />
Like the warmth of love from Romeo to Juliet,<br />
synchronizingly intertwined of life brings out the paths sunshine.<br />
To the road to tomorrow approved by a sign.<br />
<br />
