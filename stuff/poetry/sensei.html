The words we speak are more than just sounds.<br />
Apart of who we are embedded into our grounds.<br />
<br />
Our minds intertwined with the thoughts we say.<br />
Portrayal of our inner self, feelings of our own master sensei.<br />
<br />
We find out who we are when the words are spoken true.<br />
Soul searching through the waters, rowing through our life's canoe.<br />
<br />
Every time we refrain from being the words from within.<br />
We throw ourselves into the gutters of our own eternal trashbin.<br />
<br />
To become the letters that live in our soul.<br />
An alignment of truth, most assuredly keeps us in control.<br />
<br />
Safeguard the spoken thoughts, never allow them to become untrue.<br />
Symbolically stating we will never bid ourselves adieu.<br />
