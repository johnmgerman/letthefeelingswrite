Calmly rhythmical are the sounds of the season,<br />
Wondrous feelings that surround ourselves.<br />
Magical sensations embrace our souls,<br />
A graceful warmth encapsulates the Christmas season.<br />
A spirit of oneness, a spirit of togetherness,<br />
a spirit of Christmas.<br />
<br />
A joyous beginning near the yearly end,<br />
but a beginnings end that could last forever.<br />
A forever of togetherness,<br />
a forever of joyousness.<br />
<br />
Wondrously magical<br />
with the sensational feelings<br />
of graceful warmth ...<br />
within a season, within a life ...<br />
of the spirit of Christmas.<br />
<br />
Let the feelings of serenity and peaceful love<br />
spread like a warm summers eve<br />
across a cold winters night,<br />
turning a bitter world <br />
into an unconditional flame of eternal completeness.
