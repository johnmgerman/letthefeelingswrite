Visions of her dance and<br />
sing within my mind.<br />
Like the statue of David,<br />
so is she to a woman.<br />
Her eyes captivate with one look.<br />
All the essence of life is<br />
encapsulated in her beauty.<br />
One look,<br />
One glance,<br />
everything and all ... speechless.<br />
Heart feeling the words,<br />
Mind singing the thoughts.<br />
Lips ... speechless.<br />
One thought of her,<br />
one look of her ...<br />
everything and all ... speechless.<br />
May hearts do the talking,<br />
May lips remain.<br />
May the world become as speechless<br />
as the visions of her to me.<br />
