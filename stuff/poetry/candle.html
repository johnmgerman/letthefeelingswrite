A simpler, more peaceful time I bring to you,<br />
the feelings of rest I hope to glow through.<br />
I'm as common as most you can find,<br />
but my warmth I hope to leave behind.<br />
Even though my help may seem to diminish more and more,<br />
I'll continue like it was all from before.<br />
Waht a lovely scent we can bring to each other's lives,<br />
like the intoxicating perfumed thoughts of all loving husband's wives.<br />
Let the flickering of kinsmanship never be something we allow to mishandle,<br />
wouldn't it be great if everyone behaved like a candle?<br />
