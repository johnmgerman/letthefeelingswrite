Cleaning upon cleaning,<br />
scrub a dub dub,<br />
everything gets clean,<br />
but remains dirty nonetheless.<br />
<br />
New sprays, different sprays,<br />
new scrubs, different scrubs.<br />
Everything upon everything,<br />
cleanly dirty.<br />
<br />
No matter how much you try<br />
to clean your sins,<br />
the house of your soul<br />
remains a mess.<br />
<br />
The dirt, the mess,<br />
the sin ...<br />
There is only one way to cleanse<br />
the house of your soul.<br />
Soulfully and spiritually,<br />
through the greatest cleanser of all.
