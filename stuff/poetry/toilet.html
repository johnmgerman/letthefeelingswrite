Is it here waiting, for whenever you say,<br />
on guard for action, to be there for you, every single day.<br />
To unload your thoughts, to unload your mind,<br />
I'll be your shoulder to lean on, I won't be hard to find.<br />
No matter how much you give, I'll try to make sure to take,<br />
and flush away all the emotional feces of life, all for your sake.<br />
To sit with me and have a think,<br />
a refreshing letting go of your burdens, like I'm your shrink.<br />
When things build up, I'm always here, so never forget,<br />
wouldn't it be great if everyone behaved like a toilet?<br />
