Warmth of the sun bursts through the air,<br />
plant life breathes in life, breathes out life.<br />
Swaying of the wind, trees wave side-to-side.<br />
Life at its simplest, yet complex,<br />
nature, unchaotically, living within itself.<br />
<br />
Sun smiles down at everyone,<br />
warming, and greeting them, seen or not.<br />
Rays burst down onto their skin,<br />
Like being wrapped in a warm blanket escaping the cold.<br />
<br />
Nightfall darkens like a restful sleep,<br />
helping nature rejuvenate for the rest.<br />
Silence echoes like a soothing melody,<br />
rhythmically rocking nature to a lull.<br />
<br />
Day and night, day and night,<br />
equally intertwined in everything,<br />
Equally rejuvenating,<br />
equally living within natures self.<br />
<br />
Natures calming mediation of night,<br />
natures energetic enthusiasm of day,<br />
Nature erupting with life ...<br />
<br />
Nature, unchaotically, living within itself,<br />
waiting for all to be able to live,<br />
unchaotically, within natures self.
