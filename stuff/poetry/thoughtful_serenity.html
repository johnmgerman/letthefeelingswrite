Our thoughts can feel like they were love.<br />
<br />
A waterfall of heartfulness can flow down into our souls.<br />
<br />
Rippling time hears the words of our eternity.<br />
<br />
Wondrously enchanted, our emotions conduct with a melodic purity.<br />
<br />
Mindfulness appears peacefully, flickering through the candlelight of our minds.<br />
<br />
Calmly resting, tucked within the serenity of the comforter of conscieceness.<br />
