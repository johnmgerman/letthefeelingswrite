A man's hand extended, nonexistent to those who walk by. <br />
Eyes shattered of hope.
  <br />
The thoughts of tomorrow become a mere distant dream of his current reality.
  <br />
A life barely known to be alive.   <br />
Until one-day passer byers abruptly halt their strides.
Their eyes gaze into themselves.  <br />
A once unnoticed hand becomes their own. <br />
Everything that was seems different.  <br />
Though everything that is is all the same; 
except for the homeless man's face that is now hidden behind a mirror.  <br />
