My pages flutter about as I crash to the ground, thrown out the window of a car like I'm nothing.<br />  
What could I have done?  What could I have said? Words of help tossed like they are hate.<br />
It's almost like they didn't want help or need it;<br />
yet I was gifted to them because someone thought they did.<br />
A gift. I mean a gift to help them help themselves.<br />
Makes no sense when you think about it.  Who wouldn't help themselves?... right?<br />
<br />
Time dragged on until I realized this individual forgot me from their mind,<br />
which had the pages of thought turning and turning until a page settled on a certain realization of my own.<br />
As I sit here thinking about Alanis Morrisett's song about irony, don't ask, just came to mind,<br />
I, a self-help book, was sent to help an individual help themselves;<br />
and yet here I lie with the inability to help myself.<br />
Isn't it ironic, don't you think?<br />
