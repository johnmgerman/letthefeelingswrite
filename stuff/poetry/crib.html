Like a security officer, I am here to protect,<br />
I'll do everything I can to never neglect.<br />
The love you feel for those who dwell within,<br />
I will love the same as if they were my own kin.<br />
Helping to bring you a good night's sleep, I hope to also do,<br />
to lull their thoughts like their dreams have come true.<br />
This help is there for you as well,<br />
so the sweet comforts of your thoughts are like the serenading voice of Adele.<br />
And from me you will never receive a single fib,<br />
wouldn't it be great if everyone behaved like a crib?<br />
