Come in with me for a quick or long snuggle,<br />
the warmth we give each other, we'll lovingly call a huggle.<br />
Those cool nights we'll be there for one another,<br />
the protective warmth like the care of a mother.<br />
Like a tail wagging, I'm always happy when you need me,<br />
just take me by the hand as my help is pure simplicity.<br />
I'll cover you in every way, the best I can do,<br />
So, hopefully, they'll never be a moment with me that you'll feel blue.<br />
Forever let us be a oneness when we are together like a kindred spirit,<br />
wouldn't it be great if everyone behaved like a blanket?<br />
