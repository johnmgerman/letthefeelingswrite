Desperate eyes fixate on anything.<br />
Eyes as lonely as she feels.<br />
Loneliness at a table<br />
yet surrounded by life.<br />
One chair,<br />
One her,<br />
emptiness engulfs from within.<br />
Face of a life unnoticed.<br />
Seemingly so black and white<br />
yet so colorfully disorganized.<br />
Who will fill her cup of life?<br />
Who will be her hero<br />
and wear the cape?<br />
To fill a life unnoticed.<br />
To colorfully change her mood.<br />
Be the hero,<br />
wear the cape,<br />
by acknowledging<br />
a life unnoticed<br />
with a simple ...<br />
hello.
