When we see what we can give,<br />
when we love what we can live.<br />
When we know what we can do,<br />
when we see all that is new.<br />
<br />
When we find all that we know,<br />
when we be what we can grow.<br />
When we all can find our true,<br />
when we jump on life's canoe.<br />
<br />
When we give the time to see,<br />
when we become truly free.<br />
All that can bring us a feel,<br />
allows us to truly heal.<br />
<br />
So allow yourself to be,<br />
to become all that you see.<br />
And that will allow to find,<br />
the happiness in your mind.<br />
