An image of pure joy,<br />
appears every day.<br />
Soulfully lost in the,<br />
purest of forms.<br />
Hate, bitterness, shame,<br />
all nowhere to be found.<br />
Headphones on, happiness on,<br />
dancing within gratefulness.<br />
Others, zombe-like,<br />
emotionless.<br />
Like starlight in the darkness,<br />
even in day time.<br />
Music from the soul shines out,<br />
as music from without shines in.<br />
a oneness,<br />
a togetherness,<br />
within themselves,<br />
and within life.<br />
Embracing joy,<br />
emitting joy ...<br />
being joy.
