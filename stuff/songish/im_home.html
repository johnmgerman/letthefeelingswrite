When I look into your eyes,<br />
when I see you smile ...<br />
I'm Home.<br />
<br />
No matter where you are,<br />
no matter how far,<br />
just the thought of you ...<br />
I'm Home.<br />
<br />
Like the feeling of warmth<br />
coming out of the cold.<br />
Relaxing on the couch after<br />
tiredlessly being on your feet,<br />
with you ...<br />
I'm Home.<br />
<br />
That's all that's needed,<br />
I'm Home.<br />
With you,<br />
I'm Home.<br />
That's all that is needed,<br />
with you,<br />
I'm Home ... Home, home, home, home.<br />
<br />
That's all that's needed,<br />
I'm Home.<br />
With you,<br />
I'm Home.<br />
That's all that is needed,<br />
with you,<br />
I'm Home.<br />
<br />
When I look into your eyes,<br />
when I see you smile ...<br />
I'm Home.<br />
<br />
No matter where you are,<br />
no matter how far,<br />
just the thought of you ...<br />
<br />
That's all that's needed,<br />
I'm Home.<br />
With you,<br />
I'm Home.<br />
That's all that is needed,<br />
with you,<br />
I'm ... Home.
