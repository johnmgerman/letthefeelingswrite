The rainbows brightness fades away,<br />
droplets of rain begin to slow<br />
calmness of lifes stillness remain,<br />
from within, the soul yearns for more.<br />
<br />
Life could remain this way,<br />
partly empty that only one thing can fill,<br />
dreaming, wishing ...<br />
for that day ...<br />
<br />
I want to be the pot of the gold at the end of the rainbow for you,<br />
I want to be the music of life for you,<br />
dance in the rain and embrace you,<br />
like out of a movie, look into your eyes,<br />
letting you know, I'll always be there for you.<br />
<br />
When time slows and the days enver seem to end,<br />
when the gray clouds linger, and the sun stays at bay.<br />
When the desert eyes set in,<br />
no oasis of tears left to be found.<br />
<br />
Life doesn't have to be this way<br />
a void that only one thing can fill,<br />
wanting, hoping ...<br />
for the day.<br />
<br />
I want to be the pot of the gold at the end of the rainbow for you,<br />
I want to be the music of life for you,<br />
dance in the rain and embrace you,<br />
like out of a movie, look into your eyes,<br />
letting you know, I'll always be there for you.<br />
<br />
When every turn leads to a dead end,<br />
the last leaf finally gives way,<br />
every light bulb seems to dim,<br />
everything that is, no longer is.<br />
<br />
I want to be the pot of the gold at the end of the rainbow for you,<br />
I want to be the music of life for you,<br />
dance in the rain and embrace you,<br />
like out of a movie, look into your eyes,<br />
letting you know, I'll always be there for you.
