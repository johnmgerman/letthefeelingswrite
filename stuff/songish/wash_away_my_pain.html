When your blues run so deep<br />
the colors can't be found.<br />
When your sorrows are so great,<br />
nothing can help dull the pain.<br />
<br />
When the rain starts to fall,<br />
step outside and look around,<br />
and shout to the heavens,<br />
wash away my pain.<br />
<br />
Wash away my pain,<br />
wash away my pain.<br />
Let the rains from the heavens,<br />
wash away my pain.<br />
<br />
Say it with such conviction,<br />
that anyone can feel it.<br />
That when the rain falls from<br />
the heavens ...<br />
wash away my pain.<br />
<br />
With each droplet that flows off<br />
the skin,<br />
let each sorrow follow behind.<br />
Like the sun brightening up the stormy<br />
skies,<br />
let the glimmmering of rain drops leave<br />
the hope of a sorrowless tomorrow.<br />
<br />
So when the rain comes down,<br />
look up,<br />
When the rain comes down,<br />
don't give up.<br />
Just step outside and<br />
look around,<br />
and shout to the heavens<br />
wash away my pain.<br />
<br />
Wash away my pain,<br />
wash away my pain.<br />
Let the rains from the heavens,<br />
wash away my pain.<br />
<br />
Say it with such conviction,<br />
that anyone can feel it.<br />
That when the rain falls from<br />
the heavens ...<br />
wash away my pain.<br />
<br />
When your blues run so deep<br />
thte colors can't be found.<br />
When your sorrows are so great,<br />
nothing can help dull the pain.<br />
<br />
When the rain starts to fall,<br />
step outside and look around,<br />
and shout to the heavens,<br />
wash away my pain.<br />

Wash away my pain,<br />
wash away my pain.<br />
Let the rains from the heavens,<br />
wash away my pain.<br />
<br />
Say it with such conviction,<br />
that anyone can feel it.<br />
That when the rain falls from<br />
the heavens ...<br />
