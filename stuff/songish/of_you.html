When life goes wrong,<br />
you are my song.<br />
The melody of you,<br />
brings me out of the blue.<br />
<br />
The serenade of your voice,<br />
who would ever want another choice?<br />
The melody ... the serenading ... of you.<br />
<br />
Every rhythmic note of who you are,<br />
without you, would be like doing time by far.<br />
Everything about you seems to rhyme.<br />
Just the thought of not being with you should<br />
be outlawed as a crime.<br />
<br />
But all the thoughts get washed away by the sight<br />
of your song.<br />
In my mind, in my eyes ... with you<br />
time is never too long.<br />
<br />
The melody ...<br />
when life goes wrong,<br />
you are my song.<br />
<br />
The serenading ...<br />
the melody of you,<br />
brings me out of the blue.<br />
<br />
Of you ...<br />
The serenading voice,<br />
who would ever want another choice?<br />
<br />
The melody,<br />
the serenading,<br />
the melody,<br />
the serenading,<br />
who would ever want<br />
another choice?<br />
Of the melody,<br />
of the serenading ...<br />
Of you.
