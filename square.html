You can be the squarest of squares<br />
and you shouldn't carest of cares.<br />
Yourself is beautiful<br />
with who you are.<br />
Feeling the feels<br />
with no hint of an emotional scar.<br />
Day upon day<br />
with wonder in your soul.<br />
The squarest can be the carest,<br />
through a wondrous life's stroll.<br />
Day after day<br />
night after night.<br />
You no longer know<br />
like you are some fright.<br />
Dare to be<br />
what you know you see;<br />
and proudly be a square<br />
with yourself no longer to unbare.<br />
